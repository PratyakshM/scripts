# scripts
Description:
**PE-Debloat**: used to debloat a fresh copy of PixelExperience ROM for Android devices    
**RevengeOS**: used to be used by me to build RevengeOS for Xiaomi rosy, no longer used    
**remove-gapps**: used to remove most core GApps packages from Android devices    
**samsung-debloat**: used to debloat Samsung devices     
&nbsp;
**Note**: Usage of the Samsung debloat script might result in a lot of errors. While some of these might be permission restrictions, others might be that the packages don't exist. These are safe to ignore.
